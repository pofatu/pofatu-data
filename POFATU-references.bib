	abstract = {Since the first excavations by Sinoto and Kellum in 1964–1965, the Hane dune site, situated on Ua Huka, Marquesas Islands, has been considered as a key site in central Eastern Polynesia and, as such, has been utilised in different colonisation models. However, some problems remained, particularly due to the lack of full publication of the original excavation results, and it appeared that these issues could only be resolved with new investigations. In 2009, the authors opened an 18 m2 excavation that produced a controlled stratigraphy of ten layers. This paper presents the first results, focusing on the stratigraphy and new dates obtained, indicating a sequence of nearly six centuries, from early human settlement around the mid-tenth century until the abandonment of the dune around the mid-sixteenth century.},

	abstract = {The settlement of Polynesia was rapid and extensive, implying purposeful exploration and successful colonization strategies. By A.C. 1000, most inhabitable islands were occupied and inter-island voyaging was a vital link sustaining small populations on ecologically-marginal landfalls—islands that pushed the capabilities of Polynesian colonization to their limits. Several islands throughout Polynesia evidence prehistoric occupation yet were not inhabited at European contact. Henderson Island, SE Polynesia, with its extreme environmental conditions, typifies such so-called “mystery islands.” The results of a recent multidisciplinary study are summarized, which include an island-wide survey, test excavations, and the recovery of the largest artifact, faunal, and floral assemblages from this part of Polynesia. These data provide new evidence for ascertaining the role of inter-island voyaging in sustaining isolated populations, and how human colonists altered insular landscapes and caused faunal extinctions. It is argued that Henderson Island prehistory is most profitably examined within the context of regional dynamics.},

A secondary goal was to locate sites with ceramic components, particularly sites with Lapita ceramics, and relate the ceramic assemblages typologically and chronologically to those known for Western Samoa.

However, elite control of unevenly distributed resources, such as high-quality volcanic rock for adze production, may have provided an alternative source of economic power. To test this hypothesis we used nondestructive energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) analysis of 328 lithic artifacts from 36 archaeological features in the Kahikinui district, Maui Island, to geochemically characterize the source groups. This process was followed by a limited sampling using destructive wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WD-XRF) analysis to more precisely characterize certain nonlocal source groups. Seventeen geochemical groups were defined, eight of which represent extra-Maui Island sources. Although the majority of stone tools were derived from Maui Island sources (71\%), a significant quantity (27\%) of tools derived from extraisland sources, including the large Mauna Kea quarry on Hawai‘i Island as well as quarries on O‘ahu, Moloka‘i, and Lāna‘i islands. Importantly, tools quarried from extralocal sources are found in the highest frequency in elite residential features and in ritual contexts. These results suggest a significant role for a wealth economy based on the control and distribution of nonagricultural goods and resources during the rise of the Hawaiian archaic states.},

The results of geochemical analysis and thin section petrography indicate a very high probability that the adzes are Samoan with a close match to the islands of Manu'a. This provides a close correspondence with Rarotongan oral tradition. These sourcing results are discussed along with those available for adzes from other sites in the Southern Cooks.

This offers promising information on inter-community exchange networks that are not documented by ethnographic accounts. Drawing on “geochemical fingerprints”, provenance studies have slowly integrated geological data in order to better constrain the origin of archaeological material. However, the occurrence of overlapping geochemical signatures within Polynesian islands can cause difficulties when attempting to differentiate sources. Identifying clear geochemical characteristics for each island is therefore critical for a comprehensive understanding of the interaction patterns in East Polynesian societies. In this paper, we combine major and trace element data with isotopes as well as 40Ar-39Ar ages to constrain the local procurement networks that were occurring on the island of Tupua'i (Austral-Cook chain). We also demonstrate that some Tupua'i archaeological material originated from Eiao Island (Marquesas chain) circa 2000km north.

	abstract = {Polynesian adze sourcing studies that rely on geochemical analyses to assign distant artefacts to a source or quarry have been undertaken for more than three decades. Understanding intra-source geochemical variability is essential for robust artefact source assignments, yet these data are not available for most quarries. We provide a seven-step protocol for sampling source rocks and associated artefacts at quarries and, using the large Eiao quarry (Marquesas Islands) as a case study, demonstrate the efficacy of the protocol. A "sampling to redundancy" statistical procedure documents that ∼7-11 samples are required to capture the variability of 10 oxides, 49 trace elements and seven isotope ratios. We advocate using the broadest array of fully quantitative geochemical values to characterise quarries and sources that will facilitate current and future sourcing studies. In the biological sense, this is analogous to the formal description of a holotype. Quarry samples should also be collected and curated to enable research when new protocols are established and more precise and accurate geochemical techniques develop.},

	abstract = {The Marquesan island of Eiao was an important source of fine-grained basalt in Central East Polynesia, with examples being identified in archaeological assemblages throughout the region. However, compared to many other large-scale Polynesian basalt sources, little has been published about the physical extent and geochemical variability of tool-quality basalt on Eiao; prior to our study, only a single site with evidence of stone extraction had been identified and geochemi- cal information was limited to less than two dozen samples. In this paper we report geochemical data for 225 additional basalt specimens collected on Eiao. Our analyses were conducted non-destructively using three EDXRF instruments: one lab-based unit and two portable analysers. The majority of our sample, identified here as Group 1, possesses geochemical and physical characteristics similar to those reported in previous studies. Group 1 samples were collected from various locations on Eiao suggesting that, rather than being limited to a single quarry site, fine-grained basalt was extracted from multiple sources throughout the island. In addition, we identified a second group (Group 2), which possesses a distinct geochemistry, a coarser grain and often an unusual reddish colour. Evidence from Eiao indicates that Group 2 stone was regularly utilised and our analysis of an adze collected on Hiva Oa Island suggests that this material was distributed at least as far as the southern Marquesas.},

	abstract = {The Cook Islands are considered the “gateway” for human colonization of East Polynesia, the final chapter of Oceanic settlement and the last major region occupied on Earth. Indeed, East Polynesia witnessed the culmination of the greatest maritime migration in human history. Perennial debates have critiqued whether Oceanic settlement was purposeful or accidental, the timing and pathways of colonization, and the nature and extent of postcolonization voyaging—essential for small founding groups securing a lifeline between parent and daughter communities. Centering on the well-dated Tangatatau rockshelter, Mangaia, Southern Cook Islands, we charted the temporal duration and geographic spread of exotic stone adze materials—essential woodworking tools found throughout Polynesia— imported for more than 300 y beginning in the early AD 1300s. Using a technique requiring only 200 mg of sample for the geochemical analysis of trace elements and isotopes of fine-grained basalt adzes, we assigned all artifacts to an island or archipelago of origin. Adze material was identified from the chiefly complex on the Austral Islands, from the major adze quarry complex on Tutuila (Samoa), and from the Marquesas Islands more than 2,400 km distant. This interaction is the only dated example of down-the-line exchange in central East Polynesia where intermediate groups transferred commodities attesting to the interconnectedness and complexity of social relations fostered during postsettlement voyaging. For the Cook Islands, this exchange may have lasted into the 1600s, at least a century later than other East Polynesian archipelagos, suggesting that interarchipelago interaction contributed to the later development of social hierarchies.},

It is rare to see such a comprehensive report on hard data published these days, especially one so insightfully contextualised by the editors' introductory and concluding chapters. These scholars and the others involved in the work really know their stuff, and it shows. The editors connect the preoccupations of Pacific archaeologists with those of their colleagues working in other island regions and on “big questions” of colonisation, migration, interaction and patterns and processes of cultural change in hitherto-uninhabited environments. These sorts of outward-looking, big-picture contextual studies are invaluable, but all too often are missing from locally- and regionally-oriented writing, very much to its detriment. In sum, the work strongly advances our understanding of the early prehistory of Fiji through its well-integrated combination of original research and the reinterpretation of existing knowledge in the context of wider theoretical and historical concerns. In doing so The Early Prehistory of Fiji makes a truly substantial contribution to Pacific and archaeological scholarship. Professor Ian Lilley, The University of Queensland},

Although it has been proposed that additional Lapita settlements may have been distributed along the coasts of much of the archipelago, investigations have not located these deposits nor reliably dated early Polynesian Plainware deposits older than ∼2500 cal BP. We combine a chronometric hygiene protocol and a GIS-based model of the paleoshoreline to examine the temporal and spatial distribution of pre-2000 cal BP archaeological deposits in the islands. Using the currently available suite of radiocarbon dates, it is apparent that only by ∼2300–2000 cal BP were a number of settlements occupied across the archipelago. Acknowledging that a variety of geomorphological processes have changed the Sāmoan landscape, we developed a GIS-based model of the ∼3000 cal BP coastlines of Tutuila and Aunu’u Islands, which suggest that suitable sandy coastal flats had not formed in many areas prior to ∼2500 cal BP, hence limiting settlement by Lapita peoples. Our methodology, which combines an evaluation of early radiocarbon dates with a GIS-based paleoshoreline model, offers a valuable means of incorporating temporal and spatial data for the examination of coastal and island colonization.},

Population growth and expansion, elaboration of the agricultural system, and the development of socio-political complexity provide a series of problems of recent concern in Hawaiian archaeology.

	abstract = {Exchange activities, formal or otherwise, serve a variety of purposes and were prominent in many Pacific Island societies, both during island settlement and in late prehistory. Recent Polynesian studies highlight the role of exchange in the region’s most hierarchical polities where it contributed to wealth economies, emergent leadership, and status rivalry in late prehistory. Building on this research, we hypothesized that exchange in low hierarchy chiefdoms (kin-based polities where there are distinctions between commoners and elites but ranking within the latter is lacking, weak, or ephemeral) would differ in frequency and function from that associated with strongly hierarchical polities. We address this hypothesis through geochemical, morphological, and distributional analyses of stone tools on Nuku Hiva, Marquesas Islands. Non-destructive Energy-Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) and destructive Wavelength-Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (WDXRF) analyses of 278 complete and broken tools (adzes, chisels, preforms) from four valleys identify use of stone from at least seven sources on three islands: five on Nuku Hiva and one each on Eiao and Ua Pou. A functional analysis demonstrates that no tool form is limited to a particular source, while inter-valley distributions reveal that the proportions of non-local or extra-valley tools (43 to 94\%, mean = 77\%) approximate or exceed results from other archipelagoes, including those from elite and ritual sites of Polynesian archaic states. Intra-valley patterns also are unexpected, with non-local stone tools being recovered from both elite and commoner residential areas in near-equal proportions. Our findings unambiguously demonstrate the importance of exchange in late prehistoric Marquesan society, at varied social and geographic scales. We propose the observed patterns are the result of elites using non-local tools as political currency, aimed at reinforcing status, cementing client-patron relations, and building extra-valley alliances, consistent with prestige societies elsewhere and early historic accounts from the Marquesan Islands.},

	abstract = {Many publications document Easter Island's famous ahu (platform), moai (statue), pukao (topknot), and almost millennium–long culture. Yet, little investigation has been dedicated to basalt resources, artifacts, and their geochemistry. As part of the Rapa Nui Geochemical Project (2014–2017), we conducted comprehensive ﬁeldwork, material culture and archaeometric analyses focused on Easter Island's archaeological basalt industries. Our results highlight how the prehistoric Rapanui were sophisticated Polynesian stone workers who developed multiple tool reduction sequences for several types of basaltic material, creating unique anthropogenic landscapes in the process. Using laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (LA–ICP–MS) of geological source material from 31 quarries and 61 artifacts from the Sebastián Englert Anthropology Museum, we argue that similar to other culturally valuable stone (i.e. obsidian, scoria, and tuﬀ), there was communal access to and use of Rapa Nui's basalt resources. In turn, prehistoric communal access to stone hints at patterns of sociopolitical and economic interaction, including cultural connectivity on this eastern Polynesian outpost. Thus, our empirically derived archaeological conclusion casts doubt on sociopolitical and economic interpretations proposed by Easter Island's collapse narrative.},

However, little is known about the sources of these artefacts, the sequence of their manufacture and their geochemical compositions.

Although major adze quarries are known from most Polynesian archipelagos, a geologically informed archaeological survey was designed for discovering the variability in stone-tool-quality rock sources. Thirteen quarries and sources within the ∼20,000 hectare traditional land unit of Kaluako‘i (literally, the adze pit) on Moloka‘i, Hawaiian Islands, vary considerably in size, production output and settlement context, suggesting that individual adze quarries were accorded different roles across the social landscape. Some sixty-four radiocarbon age determinations and U-series dates from quarries and habitation sites with artefacts originating from quarries, document the temporal sequence of use beginning in the Late Expansion Period (ad 1400–1650), at least two centuries after settlement of the island. Further studies will report on adze technology and on-going geochemical sourcing analyses.},

	abstract = {Tonga was unique in the prehistoric Pacific for developing a maritime state that integrated the archipelago under a centralized authority and for undertaking long-distance economic and political exchanges in the second millennium A.D. To establish the extent of Tonga’s maritime polity, we geochemically analyzed stone tools excavated from the central places of the ruling paramounts, particularly lithic artifacts associated with stone-faced chiefly tombs. The lithic networks of the Tongan state focused on Samoa and Fiji, with one adze sourced to the Society Islands 2,500 km from Tongatapu. To test the hypothesis that nonlocal lithics were especially valued by Tongan elites and were an important source of political capital, we analyzed prestate lithics from Tongatapu and stone artifacts from Samoa. In the Tongan state, 66\% of worked stone tools were long-distance imports, indicating that interarchipelago connections intensified with the development of the Tongan polity after A.D. 1200. In contrast, stone tools found in Samoa were from local sources, including tools associated with a monumental structure contemporary with the Tongan state. Network analysis of lithics entering the Tongan state and of the distribution of Samoan adzes in the Pacific identified a centralized polity and the products of specialized lithic workshops, respectively. These results indicate that a significant consequence of social complexity was the establishment of new types of specialized sites in distant geographic areas. Specialized sites were loci of long-distance interaction and formed important centers for the transmission of information, people, and materials in prehistoric Oceania.},

	abstract = {The prehistoric settlement of the Pacific Ocean has intrigued scholars and stimulated anthropological debate for the past two centuries. Colonized over a few millennia during the mid to late Holocene, the islands of the Pacific-displaying a wide diversity of geological and biotic variability-provided the stage for endless "natural experiments" in human adaptation. Crucial to understanding the evolution and transformation of island societies is documenting the relative degree of interisland contacts after island colonization. In the western Pacific, ideal materials for archaeologically documenting interisland contact-obsidian, pottery, and shell ornaments-are absent or of limited geographic distribution in Polynesia. Consequently, archaeologists have relied increasingly on fine-grained basalt artifacts as a means for documenting colonization routes and subsequent interisland contacts. Routinely used x-ray fluorescence characterization of oceanic island basalt has some problems for discriminating source rocks and artifacts in provenance studies. The variation in trace and major element abundances is largely controlled by near-surface magma-chamber processes and is broadly similar between most oceanic islands. We demonstrate that Pb isotope analysis accurately discriminates rock source and is an excellent technique for charting the scale, frequency, and temporal span of imported fine-grained basalt artifacts found throughout Polynesia. The technique adds another tool for addressing evolutionary models of interaction, isolation, and cultural divergence in the eastern Pacific.},

We report on the archaeological and palaeoecological investigation of a stratified rock shelter (site AGA-3) on Agakauitai Island, revealing a sequence of environmental transformation following Polynesian colonisation of the archipelago. Radiocarbon dates indicate use of the rock shelter from the 13th to the mid-17th centuries, followed by a sterile depositional hiatus, and then final early post-contact use (late 18th to early 19th century). Zooarchaeological analysis of faunal remains indicates rapid declines in local populations of seabirds, especially procellariids, as well as later increases in numbers of the introduced, commensal Pacific rat (Rattus exulans). Macro- and micro-botanical evidence documents transformation of the island's flora from indigenous forest to one dominated by economic plants and fire-resistant taxa. A multi-causal model of dynamic interactions, including nutrient depletion due to seabird loss, most likely accounts for this dramatic ecological transformation.},

Here we report the application of nondestructive energy-dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) analysis to the sourcing of Polynesian artifacts made from basalt, one of the most ubiquitous materials in Polynesian archaeological sites. We have compared excavated and surface-collected basalt adzes and adze flakes from two sites in Samoa (site AS-13-1) and the Cook Islands (site MAN-44), with source basalts from known prehistoric quarries in these archipelagoes. In both cases, we are able to demonstrate the importing of basalt adzes from Tutuila Island, a distance of 100 km to Ofu Island, and of 1600 km to Mangaia Island. These findings are of considerable significance for Polynesian prehistory, as they demonstrate the movement of objects not only between islands in the same group (where communities were culturally and linguistically related) but also between distant island groups. Further applications of EDXRF analysis should greatly aid archaeologists in their efforts to reconstruct ancient trade and exchange networks, not only in Polynesia but also in other regions where basalt was a major material for artifact production.},

Large numbers of adzes at various stages of manufacture through to fully polished form are present. Other artefacts are bone and shell fish hooks, lure shanks, bone needles, a bird spear point, a probable bull roarer, and a seal-tooth pendant. Faunal remains consist of shellfish, marine fish, sea mammals, and birds. The site has a complex stratigraphical history, but radiocarbon dates suggest a relatively brief period of occupation ranging from AD 1400 to 1500.]},

High-quality direct evidence of this transition is rare. We report new interdisciplinary research at the archaeological site of Nan Madol that allows us to specify where and when people began to construct monumental architecture in the remote islands of the Pacific. Nan Madol is an ancient administrative and mortuary center and the former capital of the island of Pohnpei. It was constructed over 83 ha of lagoon with artificial islets and other architecture built using columnar basalt and coral. We employed geochemical sourcing of basalt used as architectural stone and high-precision uranium-thorium series dates (230Th/U) on coral from the tomb of the first chief of the entire island to identify the beginning of monument building at Nan Madol in AD 1180-1200. Over the next several centuries (AD 1300-1600) monument building began on other islands across Oceania. Future research should be aimed at resolving the causes of these social transformations through higher quality data on monument building.},

Built between A.D. 900 and 1650 over earlier settlement remains along the southern coast of Temwen Island within the fringing reef, the site is noted for its distinctive use of columnar basalt and large boulders. XRF analysis presented here suggests the site\&rsquo;s builders favoured columnar basalt from the island\&rsquo;s main shield building stage (7-8 mya) over post-shield material. Boulders incorporated in the architecture are primarily from post-shield stage Temwen Island but supplemented by some main shield boulders from mainland Pohnpei. Preliminary findings further suggest that there were shifts in the relative frequency of quarries used to construct different structures. These shifts could relate to exhaustion of accessible stone from specific sources or perhaps changing preferences for stone from different sources due to social or political imperatives.},

In order to document the nature of quarry exploitation and obsidian distribution, energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence was used to characterize the elemental composition of each source. The classification of 331 archaeological samples from inland habitation sites, ritual centers, and crematoria by discriminant analysis revealed selective patterns of obsidian usage. Obsidian from Rano Kau II was rarely used while Maunga Orito and Rano Kau I glasses were present in nearly equal proportions at inland domestic habitation sites. Motu Iti obsidian was a rare occurrence at interior locations but more frequent at coastally located ritual centers, crematoria, and caves. Surface architecture in the form of an elite house at Maunga Orito, restricted source usage, and the sacred nature of the offshore islets, suggested an elite managerial presence at two quarries in the distribution of obsidian to the island population during prehistory.},
