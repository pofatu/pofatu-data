We report on the archaeological and palaeoecological investigation of a stratified rock shelter (site {AGA}-3) on Agakauitai Island, revealing a sequence of environmental transformation following Polynesian colonisation of the archipelago. Radiocarbon dates indicate use of the rock shelter from the 13th to the mid-17th centuries, followed by a sterile depositional hiatus, and then final early post-contact use (late 18th to early 19th century). Zooarchaeological analysis of faunal remains indicates rapid declines in local populations of seabirds, especially procellariids, as well as later increases in numbers of the introduced, commensal Pacific rat (Rattus exulans). Macro- and micro-botanical evidence documents transformation of the island's flora from indigenous forest to one dominated by economic plants and fire-resistant taxa. A multi-causal model of dynamic interactions, including nutrient depletion due to seabird loss, most likely accounts for this dramatic ecological transformation.},

However, compared to many other large-scale Polynesian basalt sources, little has been published about the physical extent and geochemical variability of tool-quality basalt on Eiao; prior to our study, only a single site with evidence of stone extraction had been identified and geochemi- cal information was limited to less than two dozen samples. In this paper we report geochemical data for 225 additional basalt specimens collected on Eiao. Our analyses were conducted non-destructively using three {EDXRF} instruments: one lab-based unit and two portable analysers. The majority of our sample, identified here as Group 1, possesses geochemical and physical characteristics similar to those reported in previous studies. Group 1 samples were collected from various locations on Eiao suggesting that, rather than being limited to a single quarry site, fine-grained basalt was extracted from multiple sources throughout the island. In addition, we identified a second group (Group 2), which possesses a distinct geochemistry, a coarser grain and often an unusual reddish colour. Evidence from Eiao indicates that Group 2 stone was regularly utilised and our analysis of an adze collected on Hiva Oa Island suggests that this material was distributed at least as far as the southern Marquesas.},

We provide a seven-step protocol for sampling source rocks and associated artefacts at quarries and, using the large Eiao quarry (Marquesas Islands) as a case study, demonstrate the efficacy of the protocol. A "sampling to redundancy" statistical procedure documents that ∼7-11 samples are required to capture the variability of 10 oxides, 49 trace elements and seven isotope ratios. We advocate using the broadest array of fully quantitative geochemical values to characterise quarries and sources that will facilitate current and future sourcing studies. In the biological sense, this is analogous to the formal description of a holotype. Quarry samples should also be collected and curated to enable research when new protocols are established and more precise and accurate geochemical techniques develop.},

If true, this is further documentation of post-colonisation contact between West and East Polynesia, regions which were generally throught to have remined isolated from one another following human settlement. The results of geochemical analysis and thin section petrography indicate a very high probability that the adzes are Samoan with a close match to the islands of Manu'a. This provides a close correspondence with Rarotongan oral tradition. These sourcing results are discussed along with those available for adzes from other sites in the Southern Cooks. This evidence demonstrates significant interaction with West Polynesia during the early phase of Southern Cooks prehistory.},

However, elite control of unevenly distributed resources, such as high-quality volcanic rock for adze production, may have provided an alternative source of economic power. To test this hypothesis we used nondestructive energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence ({ED}-{XRF}) analysis of 328 lithic artifacts from 36 archaeological features in the Kahikinui district, Maui Island, to geochemically characterize the source groups. This process was followed by a limited sampling using destructive wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence ({WD}-{XRF}) analysis to more precisely characterize certain nonlocal source groups. Seventeen geochemical groups were defined, eight of which represent extra-Maui Island sources. Although the majority of stone tools were derived from Maui Island sources (71\%), a significant quantity (27\%) of tools derived from extraisland sources, including the large Mauna Kea quarry on Hawai‘i Island as well as quarries on O‘ahu, Moloka‘i, and Lāna‘i islands. Importantly, tools quarried from extralocal sources are found in the highest frequency in elite residential features and in ritual contexts. These results suggest a significant role for a wealth economy based on the control and distribution of nonagricultural goods and resources during the rise of the Hawaiian archaic states.},

We have compared excavated and surface-collected basalt adzes and adze flakes from two sites in Samoa (site {AS}-13-1) and the Cook Islands (site {MAN}-44), with source basalts from known prehistoric quarries in these archipelagoes. In both cases, we are able to demonstrate the importing of basalt adzes from Tutuila Island, a distance of 100 km to Ofu Island, and of 1600 km to Mangaia Island. These findings are of considerable significance for Polynesian prehistory, as they demonstrate the movement of objects not only between islands in the same group (where communities were culturally and linguistically related) but also between distant island groups. Further applications of {EDXRF} analysis should greatly aid archaeologists in their efforts to reconstruct ancient trade and exchange networks, not only in Polynesia but also in other regions where basalt was a major material for artifact production.},

Overall, 30\% of the artifacts analyzed via {WDXRF} derive from non-local sources, notably two other islands in the archipelago outside of the political boundaries of Moorean chiefdoms. Our case study thus provides the first direct material evidence of intra-archipelago trade and exchange in the Society Islands. Intra-archipelago trade in adzes was certainly in place by as early as A.D. 1350, if not earlier, and continued up until the time of European contact. In addition, our analyses have identified a local adze production locale in the Afareaitu district of Mo'orea island. The patterns of local versus non-local adze production and exchange strongly suggest that dual interaction spheres were involved. The correlation between adzes and adze-related debris produced from off-island sources and sites with specialized use, which were often reserved for the social, ritual, and political elites in Ma'ohi society suggests that some of the exotic adzes derived from gift exchange between Mo'orea and ruling elites in Tahiti and the Leeward Islands. These adzes from afar would have solidified socio-political and ideological alliances between elites in the Windward and Leeward sectors of the archipelago.},

The goal of that research was to reveal changes in the prehistoric settlement system of Samoa, from initial colonization of the archipelago to the time of significant European contact. The chronological placement of key sites was an essential facet of the research. A secondary goal was to locate sites with ceramic components, particularly sites with Lapita ceramics, and relate the ceramic assemblages typologically and chronologically to those known for Western Samoa. These investigations generated 16 14C dates from archaeological contexts. I present here the previously unpublished 14C data from those samples, and briefly summarize their importance for understanding Samoan prehistory.},

It is rare to see such a comprehensive report on hard data published these days, especially one so insightfully contextualised by the editors' introductory and concluding chapters. These scholars and the others involved in the work really know their stuff, and it shows. The editors connect the preoccupations of Pacific archaeologists with those of their colleagues working in other island regions and on “big questions” of colonisation, migration, interaction and patterns and processes of cultural change in hitherto-uninhabited environments. These sorts of outward-looking, big-picture contextual studies are invaluable, but all too often are missing from locally- and regionally-oriented writing, very much to its detriment. In sum, the work strongly advances our understanding of the early prehistory of Fiji through its well-integrated combination of original research and the reinterpretation of existing knowledge in the context of wider theoretical and historical concerns. In doing so The Early Prehistory of Fiji makes a truly substantial contribution to Pacific and archaeological scholarship. Professor Ian Lilley, The University of Queensland},

Although it has been proposed that additional Lapita settlements may have been distributed along the coasts of much of the archipelago, investigations have not located these deposits nor reliably dated early Polynesian Plainware deposits older than ∼2500 cal {BP}. We combine a chronometric hygiene protocol and a {GIS}-based model of the paleoshoreline to examine the temporal and spatial distribution of pre-2000 cal {BP} archaeological deposits in the islands. Using the currently available suite of radiocarbon dates, it is apparent that only by ∼2300–2000 cal {BP} were a number of settlements occupied across the archipelago. Acknowledging that a variety of geomorphological processes have changed the Sāmoan landscape, we developed a {GIS}-based model of the ∼3000 cal {BP} coastlines of Tutuila and Aunu’u Islands, which suggest that suitable sandy coastal flats had not formed in many areas prior to ∼2500 cal {BP}, hence limiting settlement by Lapita peoples. Our methodology, which combines an evaluation of early radiocarbon dates with a {GIS}-based paleoshoreline model, offers a valuable means of incorporating temporal and spatial data for the examination of coastal and island colonization.},

Population growth and expansion, elaboration of the agricultural system, and the development of socio-political complexity provide a series of problems of recent concern in Hawaiian archaeology. Within this framework archaeological research focusing on prehistoric agricultural change was conducted for three seasons in windward valleys of the {NW} section of the Island of Hawai'i.

This paper presents the first results, focusing on the stratigraphy and new dates obtained, indicating a sequence of nearly six centuries, from early human settlement around the mid-tenth century until the abandonment of the dune around the mid-sixteenth century.},

Colonized over a few millennia during the mid to late Holocene, the islands of the Pacific–displaying a wide diversity of geological and biotic variability–provided the stage for endless "natural experiments" in human adaptation. Crucial to understanding the evolution and transformation of island societies is documenting the relative degree of interisland contacts after island colonization. In the western Pacific, ideal materials for archaeologically documenting interisland contact–obsidian, pottery, and shell ornaments–are absent or of limited geographic distribution in Polynesia. Consequently, archaeologists have relied increasingly on fine-grained basalt artifacts as a means for documenting colonization routes and subsequent interisland contacts. Routinely used x-ray fluorescence characterization of oceanic island basalt has some problems for discriminating source rocks and artifacts in provenance studies. The variation in trace and major element abundances is largely controlled by near-surface magma-chamber processes and is broadly similar between most oceanic islands. We demonstrate that Pb isotope analysis accurately discriminates rock source and is an excellent technique for charting the scale, frequency, and temporal span of imported fine-grained basalt artifacts found throughout Polynesia. The technique adds another tool for addressing evolutionary models of interaction, isolation, and cultural divergence in the eastern Pacific.},

Several islands throughout Polynesia evidence prehistoric occupation yet were not inhabited at European contact. Henderson Island, {SE} Polynesia, with its extreme environmental conditions, typifies such so-called “mystery islands.” The results of a recent multidisciplinary study are summarized, which include an island-wide survey, test excavations, and the recovery of the largest artifact, faunal, and floral assemblages from this part of Polynesia. These data provide new evidence for ascertaining the role of inter-island voyaging in sustaining isolated populations, and how human colonists altered insular landscapes and caused faunal extinctions. It is argued that Henderson Island prehistory is most profitably examined within the context of regional dynamics.},

Indeed, East Polynesia witnessed the culmination of the greatest maritime migration in human history. Perennial debates have critiqued whether Oceanic settlement was purposeful or accidental, the timing and pathways of colonization, and the nature and extent of postcolonization voyaging—essential for small founding groups securing a lifeline between parent and daughter communities. Centering on the well-dated Tangatatau rockshelter, Mangaia, Southern Cook Islands, we charted the temporal duration and geographic spread of exotic stone adze materials—essential woodworking tools found throughout Polynesia— imported for more than 300 y beginning in the early {AD} 1300s. Using a technique requiring only 200 mg of sample for the geochemical analysis of trace elements and isotopes of fine-grained basalt adzes, we assigned all artifacts to an island or archipelago of origin. Adze material was identified from the chiefly complex on the Austral Islands, from the major adze quarry complex on Tutuila (Samoa), and from the Marquesas Islands more than 2,400 km distant. This interaction is the only dated example of down-the-line exchange in central East Polynesia where intermediate groups transferred commodities attesting to the interconnectedness and complexity of social relations fostered during postsettlement voyaging. For the Cook Islands, this exchange may have lasted into the 1600s, at least a century later than other East Polynesian archipelagos, suggesting that interarchipelago interaction contributed to the later development of social hierarchies.},

	abstract = {Stone tool geochemistry provides hard evidence for post-settlement voyaging and inter-island contacts in East Polynesia. This offers promising information on inter-community exchange networks that are not documented by ethnographic accounts. Drawing on “geochemical fingerprints”, provenance studies have slowly integrated geological data in order to better constrain the origin of archaeological material. However, the occurrence of overlapping geochemical signatures within Polynesian islands can cause difficulties when attempting to differentiate sources. Identifying clear geochemical characteristics for each island is therefore critical for a comprehensive understanding of the interaction patterns in East Polynesian societies. In this paper, we combine major and trace element data with isotopes as well as 40Ar-39Ar ages to constrain the local procurement networks that were occurring on the island of Tupua'i (Austral-Cook chain). We also demonstrate that some Tupua'i archaeological material originated from Eiao Island (Marquesas chain) circa 2000km north. This represents the first hard evidence for inter-island connections between the Austral and the Marquesas Archipelagos.},

	abstract = {Tonga was unique in the prehistoric Pacific for developing a maritime state that integrated the archipelago under a centralized authority and for undertaking long-distance economic and political exchanges in the second millennium A.D. To establish the extent of Tonga’s maritime polity, we geochemically analyzed stone tools excavated from the central places of the ruling paramounts, particularly lithic artifacts associated with stone-faced chiefly tombs. The lithic networks of the Tongan state focused on Samoa and Fiji, with one adze sourced to the Society Islands 2,500 km from Tongatapu. To test the hypothesis that nonlocal lithics were especially valued by Tongan elites and were an important source of political capital, we analyzed prestate lithics from Tongatapu and stone artifacts from Samoa. In the Tongan state, 66\% of worked stone tools were long-distance imports, indicating that interarchipelago connections intensified with the development of the Tongan polity after A.D. 1200. In contrast, stone tools found in Samoa were from local sources, including tools associated with a monumental structure contemporary with the Tongan state. Network analysis of lithics entering the Tongan state and of the distribution of Samoan adzes in the Pacific identified a centralized polity and the products of specialized lithic workshops, respectively. These results indicate that a significant consequence of social complexity was the establishment of new types of specialized sites in distant geographic areas. Specialized sites were loci of long-distance interaction and formed important centers for the transmission of information, people, and materials in prehistoric Oceania.},

	abstract = {Exchange activities, formal or otherwise, serve a variety of purposes and were prominent in many Pacific Island societies, both during island settlement and in late prehistory. Recent Polynesian studies highlight the role of exchange in the region’s most hierarchical polities where it contributed to wealth economies, emergent leadership, and status rivalry in late prehistory. Building on this research, we hypothesized that exchange in low hierarchy chiefdoms (kin-based polities where there are distinctions between commoners and elites but ranking within the latter is lacking, weak, or ephemeral) would differ in frequency and function from that associated with strongly hierarchical polities. We address this hypothesis through geochemical, morphological, and distributional analyses of stone tools on Nuku Hiva, Marquesas Islands. Non-destructive Energy-Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence ({EDXRF}) and destructive Wavelength-Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence ({WDXRF}) analyses of 278 complete and broken tools (adzes, chisels, preforms) from four valleys identify use of stone from at least seven sources on three islands: five on Nuku Hiva and one each on Eiao and Ua Pou. A functional analysis demonstrates that no tool form is limited to a particular source, while inter-valley distributions reveal that the proportions of non-local or extra-valley tools (43 to 94\%, mean = 77\%) approximate or exceed results from other archipelagoes, including those from elite and ritual sites of Polynesian archaic states. Intra-valley patterns also are unexpected, with non-local stone tools being recovered from both elite and commoner residential areas in near-equal proportions. Our findings unambiguously demonstrate the importance of exchange in late prehistoric Marquesan society, at varied social and geographic scales. We propose the observed patterns are the result of elites using non-local tools as political currency, aimed at reinforcing status, cementing client-patron relations, and building extra-valley alliances, consistent with prestige societies elsewhere and early historic accounts from the Marquesan Islands.},

	abstract = {Reconstructing routes of ancient long-distance voyaging, long a topic of speculation, has become possible thanks to advances in the geochemical sourcing of archaeological artifacts. Of particular interest are islands classified as Polynesian Outliers, where people speak Polynesian languages and have distinctly Polynesian cultural traits, but are located within the Melanesian or Micronesian cultural areas. While the classification of these groups as Polynesian is not in dispute, the material evidence for the movement between Polynesia and the Polynesian Outliers is exceedingly rare, unconfirmed, and in most cases, nonexistent. We report on the first comprehensive sourcing (using a portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer) of obsidian and volcanic glass artifacts recovered from excavations on the Polynesian Outlier island of Tikopia. We find evidence for: (1) initial settlement followed by continued voyages between Tikopia and an island Melanesian homeland; (2) long-distance voyaging becoming much less frequent and continuing to decline; and (3) later voyaging from Polynesia marked by imports of volcanic glass from Tonga beginning at 765 cal yr {BP} (±54 yr). Later long-distance voyages from Polynesia were surprisingly rare, given the strong cultural and linguistic influences of Polynesia, and we suggest, may indicate that Tikopia was targeted by Tongans for political expansion.},

In this study, clear differentiation of each analyzed quarry was achieved using {INAA}. Biplots of canonical discriminant analysis ({CDA}) scores for the {INAA} data illustrate clear separation based on the variation in chemical composition between each quarry. The samples analyzed not only define quarry separation, but also provide the “core group” for a preliminary baseline necessary for future artifact-centered provenance studies. Inclusion of these “core group” samples in the baseline was confirmed by stepwise discriminant analysis. These findings suggest the ability to determine artifact quarry of origin on the island of Tutuila, which can elucidate the importance of individual Tutuilan quarries in the production, distribution and consumption of fine-grained basalt artifacts in Polynesia.},

We defined the approximate limits of the quarry complex, located the in situ geological source of the fine-grained basalt used for adze manufacture, report the petrographic and geochemical variability of the source rock, and describe the adze reduction strategies from analysis of adze blanks andpreforms, as well as hammerstones and debitage. The geochemical variation of the nine source rocks and artefacts were defined by a comprehensive array of 10 fully quantitative major element concentrations, 43 trace element abundances, and high-precision Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic ratios obtained using the state-of-the-art Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry ({TIMS}, for Sr isotopes), Multi-Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry ({MC}-{ICP}-{MS}, for Nd-Pb isotopes), quadrupole {ICP}-{MS} (for trace elements) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry ({ICP}-{OES}, for major elements), respectively. A piece of branch coral was recovered from the surface of a rockshelter that provided a U-series date of possible quarry use in the mid-13th century. It is advocated that a comprehensive range of major and trace element concentrations and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic ratios are required for geochemically characterising adze quarries to facilitate the long-term viability of sourcing studies.},

In the first instance, we dated nut shell fragments from the Polynesian introduced candlenut (kukui, Aleurites moluccana), from the original radiocarbon sample collection curated at the Bishop Museum, producing a calibrated age (at 2 σ) of {AD} 690-895 (Beta-336756). Our renewed excavations obtained appropriate short-lived twig wood for dating in addition to another date on candlenut. Four dates produced a calibrated median age of {AD} 1770, more in line with expectations for late prehistoric settlement in these marginal leeward regions. However, the oldest date was not contaminated with old carbon and satisfies all aspects of ‘chronometric hygiene’. Because of this unusually early date (especially on a Polynesian introduced plant), we report in detail its leeward site context, additional dates, depositional context, stratigraphic sequence and the cultural inventory of the {MO}-B6-161 site as well as the details of sample pretreatment and discuss the absence of sources of carbon contamination. High-quality geochemistry of adze source rock is also presented, thus facilitating island and archipelago-wide interaction studies.},

Tongan tradition and archaeology combine to show that these were the setting for new ceremonies instituted by the emergent Tu’i Tonga lineage in the fourteenth century {AD} as they laid the foundations of the early Tongan chiefdom. Key to their success were activities that emphasised the sacred origins of the living Tu’i Tonga, including the drinking of kava and the presentation of first fruits to the chiefs.},

Six obsidian artifacts were sourced to the Banks Islands, northern Vanuatu, supporting the hypothesis that sources there were known and utilized from the initial colonization of the Vanuatu Archipelago. A single artifact from the West New Britain subsource of Mopir was found. This is the only Lapita-period Mopir obsidian artifact found so far outside the Bismarck Archipelago.

This paper presents the re-analysis of 18 obsidian artefacts from Lakeba using {LA}–{ICP}–{MS} and radiogenic isotope results that demonstrate that the Lakeba obsidian is not from Vanuatu, and it most likely derives from the Fiji–Tonga region.

Here we present new research from a coastal site on the North Island of New Zealand at Cooks Beach where anthropogenic vegetation changes are seen using microfossil analysis of obsidian tools, sediments and pit fill. The results indicate the initial presence of people in {AD} 1300–1400 followed by subsequent periods of disuse or abandonment and sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) cultivation. Around the time of initial settlement, obsidian from this location is found at sites across the country. After {AD} 1400 the area appears to be deserted for a century or more, after which we see evidence for the cultivation of sweet potato in {AD} 1500 as evidenced by extensive soil modification and numerous storage pits. There is no evidence of a permanent settlement at the site. The geographic distribution of Cooks Beach obsidian was constricted while the site was used for sweet potato cultivation, a pattern often attributed to increased warfare. It appears cultivation was abandoned after {AD} 1650 marking a second secession of use, a fact confirmed in {AD} 1769 when Captain Cook visited the area. We consider the possible drivers for the late abandonment of cultivation at Cooks Beach.},

We report on new research on the geographic range of interaction spheres in the first centuries of occupation of New Zealand based on geochemical source identifications from obsidian assemblages found along the coast of the Otago region in the southern South Island. Results suggest that while there is evidence for interaction spanning the entire archipelago, logistical limitations on long-distance mobility along the long north-south axis of New Zealand appear to have developed early on and may be important in understanding the development of territories later in Māori culture history.},

Faunal and artefactual analyses indicate that the main function of the settlement was open-sea fishing for red cod and barracouta in particular. This is the first specialised fishing site of the Archaic period which has been reported in Otago, and its existence reinforces other evidence of functional variation in the settlement patterns of that time.},

	abstract = {Circumscription theory, originally proposed to explain the rise of state society, is appealing in that it gives us an elegant, straightforward way to account for warfare among farming communities in the transition to complex societies. It predicts that as populations increase, groups will come in to conflict over limited prime land, and thus explain why we see a spatial correlation between good farmland and fortifications; as has been noted in New Zealand (Aotearoa). But, to date we do not have strong data to support the notion that conflict between Maori was primarily about access to farmland, and counter to circumscription theory, ethnography suggests exclusive ownership was discouraged. Here we test the efficacy of circumscription for understanding Maori history using obsidian artefact data from Pouerua Pa, a fortification in the heart of Ngā Puhi's tribal territory. New geochemical sourcing clears up ambiguities in source assignments and shows shifts in access to local sources and long distance exchange. We interpret these changes as being consistent with circumscription having been a factor in the earliest stage of fortification construction, and easing over time as the area was largely confederated under a single tribal identity in the early post-contact period.},

Here we use collections of obsidian artefacts that date to a period of endemic warfare among Maori during New Zealand's Late Period (1500–1769 A.D.) to determine what strategies people engaged in to obtain obsidian, namely (1) collecting raw material directly from a natural source, (2) informal trade and exchange, and (3) formal trade and exchange. These deposits represent a good cross-section of Late Period archaeology, including primary working of raw material at a natural source (Helena Bay), undefended sites where people discarded rubbish and worked obsidian (Bream Head), and a heavily fortified site (Mt. Wellington). We find that most of the obsidian described here was likely obtained directly from natural sources, especially those located on off-shore islands within about 60–70 km of sites. A smaller amount comes from blocks of material transported from an off-shore island a greater distance away, called Mayor Island, in a formal trade and exchange network. This study demonstrates the value of conducting tandem lithic technology and geochemical sourcing studies to understand how people create and maintain social networks during periods of warfare.},

	abstract = {Teti'aroa, located 28 nautical miles (52 km) north of Tahiti, lies at the periphery of the Windward Society islands. At the end of the eighteenth century, this atoll was presumably controlled by the chiefdom of Porionu'u, which included the districts of Pare and Arue on the north coast of Tahiti. This situation is confirmed by a number of ethnohistorical accounts and oral traditions describing an intense traffic of basic resources between the atoll and Tahiti island as well as the specific function of Teti'aroa for Tahitian social elites visiting the atoll for ceremonial or recreational purposes. However, the prehistory of the atoll remains largely unknown and the time-depth of dominance by Tahitian elites on the atoll is unclear. In this paper, we investigate potential inter-island relationships between Teti'aroa and other islands in the archipelago and beyond. We present geochemical analyses (energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry) of stone tools and elements of ceremonial architecture (marae), which were necessarily imported given the complete subsidence of the volcanic substratum of the island. Our results confirm the regional origin of a majority of artefacts, but also indicate several later long-distance relationships maintained by Tahitian chiefs.},

There are multiple obsidian sources located on the island, of which it has been reported that some of it was exploited for use prehistorically. Although there have been basic reports made on these sources in the past, the island has never been subject to in-depth analysis. This thesis presents information pertaining to the differing quality of the obsidian that is present on the island; its abundance, availability and geochemical variation. It then takes the information gained from these analyses and compares it to archaeological obsidians recovered from six prehistoric sites located within the Tamaki Region which showed that the only source that was exploited on Aotea was one which is associated with Te Ahumata, a mountain consisting of mainly rhyolitic sinter. This source was not prevalent in the Tamaki Region during the Archaic phase of occupation but became the dominant source in the later Classic phase, when it became more common than obsidian from Mayor Island, New Zealand‘s most exploited obsidian source.},

In order to document the nature of quarry exploitation and obsidian distribution, energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence was used to characterize the elemental composition of each source. The classification of 331 archaeological samples from inland habitation sites, ritual centers, and crematoria by discriminant analysis revealed selective patterns of obsidian usage. Obsidian from Rano Kau {II} was rarely used while Maunga Orito and Rano Kau I glasses were present in nearly equal proportions at inland domestic habitation sites. Motu Iti obsidian was a rare occurrence at interior locations but more frequent at coastally located ritual centers, crematoria, and caves. Surface architecture in the form of an elite house at Maunga Orito, restricted source usage, and the sacred nature of the offshore islets, suggested an elite managerial presence at two quarries in the distribution of obsidian to the island population during prehistory.},

Boulders incorporated in the architecture are primarily from post-shield stage Temwen Island but supplemented by some main shield boulders from mainland Pohnpei. Preliminary findings further suggest that there were shifts in the relative frequency of quarries used to construct different structures. These shifts could relate to exhaustion of accessible stone from specific sources or perhaps changing preferences for stone from different sources due to social or political imperatives.},

Large numbers of adzes at various stages of manufacture through to fully polished form are present.

Faunal remains consist of shellfish, marine fish, sea mammals, and birds.

These geological and archaeological sites provided the raw materials for tools such as toki (adzes and picks), which facilitated the manufacture of Easter Island’s iconic stonework. Other basaltic tools such as hoe (knives), ohio (axes) and mangai ma¯‘ea (stone ﬁshhooks) served for subsistence practices. However, little is known about the sources of these artefacts, the sequence of their manufacture and their geochemical compositions. In this paper, we provide archaeological site descriptions and geochemistry of source material from the Rua Tokitoki quarry and a ﬁne-grain basalt locality on Poike to contribute towards an understanding of prehistoric mining, social interaction and elite oversight on this isolated East Polynesian outpost.},

Yet, little investigation has been dedicated to basalt resources, artifacts, and their geochemistry. As part of the Rapa Nui Geochemical Project (2014–2017), we conducted comprehensive ﬁeldwork, material culture and archaeometric analyses focused on Easter Island's archaeological basalt industries. Our results highlight how the prehistoric Rapanui were sophisticated Polynesian stone workers who developed multiple tool reduction sequences for several types of basaltic material, creating unique anthropogenic landscapes in the process. Using laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry ({LA}–{ICP}–{MS}) of geological source material from 31 quarries and 61 artifacts from the Sebastián Englert Anthropology Museum, we argue that similar to other culturally valuable stone (i.e. obsidian, scoria, and tuﬀ), there was communal access to and use of Rapa Nui's basalt resources. In turn, prehistoric communal access to stone hints at patterns of sociopolitical and economic interaction, including cultural connectivity on this eastern Polynesian outpost. Thus, our empirically derived archaeological conclusion casts doubt on sociopolitical and economic interpretations proposed by Easter Island's collapse narrative.},

	abstract = {Polynesian stone adze quarries anchor the system of tool production, distribution and consumption and are critical for examining changing social organization, symbolic values attributed to particular stone sources, economic intensification and ancient interaction. Although major adze quarries are known from most Polynesian archipelagos, a geologically informed archaeological survey was designed for discovering the variability in stone-tool-quality rock sources. Thirteen quarries and sources within the ∼20,000 hectare traditional land unit of Kaluako‘i (literally, the adze pit) on Moloka‘i, Hawaiian Islands, vary considerably in size, production output and settlement context, suggesting that individual adze quarries were accorded different roles across the social landscape. Some sixty-four radiocarbon age determinations and U-series dates from quarries and habitation sites with artefacts originating from quarries, document the temporal sequence of use beginning in the Late Expansion Period (ad 1400–1650), at least two centuries after settlement of the island. Further studies will report on adze technology and on-going geochemical sourcing analyses.},
